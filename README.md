## Project 3: Coding Requirements
- Must Include authentication (JWT)
- Must use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database
- Must use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server
- Must use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data
- Must be deployed using Heroku (with data)
- Must have a polished UI
- Must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)

## - Project 3: Additional Requirements
- Must protect sensitive API key information on the server
- Must have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards
- Must look professional and be mobile-friendly
- Must have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies
- used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)

## CSS Styling (Optional)
- Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:
- Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level. (Popular
libraries include styled-components and Emotion)
- Try using a component library, such as Semantic UI, Chakra UI, or Ant Design
- Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS
- Regardless of which these options you choose—it just needs to look professional and be
mobile-friendly

## Payment Platform (Optional)
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even
if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could
set up your site to accept charitable donations.

##
Bonus
Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to
meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
Uses a web manifest
Is installable
Uses a service worker for offline functionality

## Presentation Requirements
You will be responsible for preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers the following:
1. Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
2. Elevator pitch: a one-minute description of your application
3. Process: What technologies did you use? How did you break down and assign tasks and roles?
4. What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
5. Demo: Show your stuff!
6. Directions for future development
7. Links to to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

## Project Metrics
Your project will be evaluated on the following:
- Concept
- Design (application quality)
- Functionality (meets all technical acceptance criteria)
- Presentation
- Collaboration
- Repository quality
- Deployment
